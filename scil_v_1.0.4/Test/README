The test scripts assume that there is one directory containing
the compiler directory, Compiler, and this test directory, Test.

Files with suffix .src are source files and files with suffix .eop
contain expected output of the corresponding source files. All
other files are test scripts of various kinds.

A good start is to be in the directory Test and run the command

> ./runAllTests

This will check and report on all the test files in the directory.
